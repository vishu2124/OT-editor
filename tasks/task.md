# Task: Develop a Confluence-like Software

## Objective
Design and implement a Confluence-like collaboration platform with a focus on user management, document management, real-time collaboration, and integrations. The platform should be intuitive, scalable, and secure, enabling teams to create, organize, and collaborate on content efficiently.

## Core Features

### 1. User Management and Access Control

#### User Roles and Permissions
- **Task**: Implement granular user roles (Admin, Space Admin, Editor, Viewer) to control permissions for creating, editing, and viewing content.
- **Details**:
  - **Admin**: Full access to all spaces, user management, and system settings.
  - **Space Admin**: Manage specific spaces (create, delete, configure permissions).
  - **Editor**: Create and edit content within permitted spaces.
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to permitted content.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
  - Store roles and permissions in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL table with user_id, role, and permissions).
  - Provide an admin dashboard to assign and modify roles.

#### User Authentication
- **Task**: Implement secure login with email/password and SSO integration.
- **Details**:
  - Support email/password authentication with password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
  - Integrate SSO providers (Google, Microsoft) using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect.
  - Include multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an optional security layer.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use an authentication library like Auth0 or Firebase Authentication.
  - Ensure secure session management with JWT or similar tokens.

#### Access Restrictions
- **Task**: Enable users to restrict access to specific pages or spaces.
- **Details**:
  - Allow locking a document to make it read-only or restrict to specific user groups.
  - Support group-based permissions (e.g., "Marketing Team" group has edit access).
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a permissions field to the document/space schema (e.g., JSON object defining allowed users/groups).
  - Provide UI controls for setting restrictions (e.g., dropdowns for selecting users or groups).

### 2. Document Management

#### Spaces
- **Task**: Create "Spaces" as containers for related pages and documents.
- **Details**:
  - Each space acts as a project folder or team wiki.
  - Support space creation, deletion, and configuration (e.g., name, description, permissions).
- **Implementation**:
  - Store spaces in a database table (e.g., `spaces` with columns: `id`, `name`, `description`, `owner_id`).
  - Associate spaces with users and permissions.

#### Pages and Hierarchy
- **Task**: Enable creation of pages within spaces with a hierarchical tree structure.
- **Details**:
  - Pages can be nested to create parent-child relationships.
  - Support drag-and-drop reordering of pages in the tree.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a tree data structure (e.g., adjacency list or nested set model) in the database.
  - Provide API endpoints for creating, updating, and reordering pages.

#### Templates
- **Task**: Provide pre-built templates for common document types.
- **Details**:
  - Include templates for meeting notes, project plans, and knowledge base articles.
  - Allow users to create custom templates.
- **Implementation**:
  - Store templates as JSON objects or markdown files in the database.
  - Provide a template selection UI during page creation.

#### Version History
- **Task**: Automatically save document revisions and allow viewing, comparing, and restoring versions.
- **Details**:
  - Store every change with a timestamp and user ID.
  - Support side-by-side comparison of versions.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a versioning table (e.g., `page_versions` with columns: `page_id`, `version`, `content`, `user_id`, `timestamp`).
  - Implement a diff algorithm (e.g., Levenshtein or Myers diff) for comparison.

#### Archiving
- **Task**: Enable archiving of old or irrelevant pages.
- **Details**:
  - Archived pages are hidden but recoverable.
  - Provide an archive management interface.
- Hawkins**:
  - Add an `archived` boolean field to the page schema.
  - Create an archive view in the UI for restoring or permanently deleting pages.

#### Search
- **Task**: Implement a powerful search engine for titles and document content.
- **Details**:
  - Support full-text search across all spaces and pages.
  - Include filters for spaces, authors, or date ranges.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a search engine like Elasticsearch or a database full-text search (e.g., PostgreSQL `tsvector`).
  - Index page titles and content for efficient querying.

### 3. Collaboration and Editing

#### Real-time Multi-user Editing
- **Task**: Enable multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously.
- ** tosc**:
  - Implement conflict-free real-time synchronization.
  - Use Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a WebSocket-based library (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time updates.
  - Store document state in a database and broadcast changes to connected clients.

#### Presence Indicators
- **Task**: Show who is currently viewing or editing a document.
- **Details**:
  - Display user icons or names at the top of the page.
  - Update indicators in real-time.
- **Implementation**:
  - Track user sessions via WebSocket or server-side events.
  - Update UI with user presence data.

#### Comments and Mentions
- **Task**: Allow comments on specific document sections and user tagging.
- **Details**:
  - Support inline comments tied to specific text selections.
  - Notify tagged users via email or in-app notifications.
- **Implementation**:
  - Store comments in a separate table (e.g., `comments` with `page_id`, `text_range`, `content`, `user_id`).
  - Integrate a notification system (e.g., via email or WebSocket).

#### Document Locking
- **Task**: Allow temporary locking of a document to prevent concurrent edits.
- **Details**:
補足:
  - Lock can be set by the document owner or space admin.
  - Notify users when a document is locked.
- **Implementation**:
  - Add a `locked_by` field to the page schema.
